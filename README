== Cloud map and reduce for machine learning large jobs

This is the second implementation using ETL splitting technique over large html corpus for PUC's Cloud course. It's based on Sinatra and CloudCrowd.

To develop and test crowd actions, it will be easier to have the binaries installed:

  sudo gem install thin
  sudo gem install cloud-crowd

As of now the project is split into two sub-projects. So first, clone it:

  git clone git@github.com:moret/cc.git

Now open two terminals and go into each sub-project. First, web:

  cd cc/web
  bundle install
  ./run.sh

After that, crowd:

  cd cc/crowd
  bundle install
  ./setup.sh
  ./run.sh
